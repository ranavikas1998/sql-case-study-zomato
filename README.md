# Zomato SQL Case Study

Analyze and explore insights from Zomato restaurant data using SQL queries and case studies.

---

##  Overview
A comprehensive SQL case study on the Zomato dataset—designed to demonstrate data extraction, transformation, and insightful analysis using SQL.

---

##  Key Features
- **Complete SQL Workflow**: Schema creation, data loading, cleaning, and advanced querying.
- **Business-Oriented Questions**: Solved real-world dataset problems like rating correlations, cuisine trends, cost analysis, etc.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Derive insights like top cuisines, popular locations, online ordering impact, and more.
- **Skill Showcase**: Emphasizes advanced SQL techniques—JOINs, aggregations, window functions, conditional logic, subqueries.

---

##  Tools & Technologies
- **SQL Database**: MySQL / sql server
- **SQL Scripts**:
  - Schema and table creation
  - Data import/loading scripts
  - Analytical queries
- **Optional EDA Notebook**: Jupyter/Python environment for exploratory visualizations (if included)

---

##  Sample Analytical Questions
1. How many restaurants accept online orders?
2. What percentage offer table booking?
3. What’s the average cost for two based on restaurant type or cuisine?
4. Is there a correlation between approximate cost and ratings?
5. Which cuisines are most popular?
6. What are the top-rated restaurants in each neighborhood?
7. Compare ratings between online-order-enabled vs. non-online restaurants.

##  How to Run
1. **Clone the repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ranavikas1998/sql-case-study-zomato.git
   cd sql-case-study-zomato
   ```

2. **Set up your database** (e.g., PostgreSQL)
   - Create a database: `CREATE DATABASE zomato_case;`
   - Run `schema.sql` to create tables.
   - Load data via `load_data.sql` or import CSV files manually.

3. **Execute analysis queries**  
   Open `analysis_queries.sql` in your SQL client to run and explore analytics.

4. **Explore results**  
   Optionally create visual summaries (bar charts, trend lines) using tools like Python or BI platforms.
